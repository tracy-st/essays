Van Gogh occupied two large ones on the ground floor to serve as an atelier (workshop) and kitchen, and on the first floor, two smaller ones facing Place Lamartine. 

The window on the first floor nearest the corner with both shutters open is that of ==van Gogh's guest room, where Paul Gauguin lived=={2444,1755,1730,1344,529bba37} for nine weeks from late October 1888. 

Behind the next window, with shutters nearly closed, is ==van Gogh's bedroom=={2566,2019,1300,1010,b53cd661}. The two small rooms at the rear were rented by van Gogh at a later time.
